## Installation
You need to have VS Code, Node and GitBash(Windows)

## Usage

Once you have the necessary technologies installed, you will need to clone down the repository so it is within your local filesystem. Then you will need open the directory in VS code as well as the already existing terminal. You ill then need to run the command 'node index.js'. Questions will then begin to appear in your terminal. When you have answered all of the questions you will see a README file appear within your directory. You can then use this to create all of your README files.

## Tests

You can test my application by firstly running the command 'node index.js' as this should prompt the questions. You can also enter a link where prompted and ensure this then creates as a functional link as well as ensuring a badge appears when a license is selected or that the section isn't created if the option 'none' is selected.
