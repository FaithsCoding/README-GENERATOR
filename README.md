## Technologies Used

Within this application I have used NODE.

## Challenges Faced

I found it difficult to ensure that I had the correct version of inquirer installed and this was causing a lot of errors and bugs.

## Successes Achieved

I worked with BCS in resolving the issue with my version of inquirer. Other successes I had was being able to apply our class lessons to create the question prompts and incorportating them into a statement that allowed it to run successfully. I also found it was better practice to split the files up therefore I had to incoportate module exports too.
